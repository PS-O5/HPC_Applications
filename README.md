# HPC_Applications
These are few HPC implementation codes/snippets which I am sharing with permission to share them. You can use them if you want. :)

Some snippets/code might be absent/faulty due to the reasons of licensing/trade-secret/good will in the favor of the company. Also, few changes might be required to make executable. Sorry for this!
