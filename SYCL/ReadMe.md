Install a SYCL implementation: There are several SYCL implementations available, such as ComputeCpp and DPC++. You can follow the installation instructions provided by the implementation you choose.

Install the required dependencies: You'll need to install the SYCL headers and the OpenCL headers, which are needed by some SYCL implementations. On Ubuntu, you can install them with the following command:

` sudo apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev opencl-headers `

Compile the code: To compile the code, you'll need to specify the SYCL implementation's include and library paths, as well as the OpenCL library path. For example, if you're using ComputeCpp, you can compile the code with the following command:

` compute++ -std=c++17 -I /path/to/computecpp/include -L /path/to/computecpp/lib -lComputeCpp -lOpenCL matrix_mul.cpp -o matrix_mul `
